# The-Boxplot-Function
A project for the course Fundamentals of Data Analysis investigating the boxplot function. Submitted by James Quintin to Dr. Ian Mcloughlin.

This project uses the Jupyter Notebook [1] to present live code, visualizations and explanations investigating the boxplot funtion. The code is written in  Python [2] and uses the Anaconda [3] distribution package that contains all necessary software to run this notebook.  

The notebook first explains what a boxplot is then explains the history and use of the boxplot. Examples of boxplots are then presented using python code. References then follows.
