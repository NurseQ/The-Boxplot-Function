# The Boxplot Function
A project investigating the boxplot function for the course Fundamentals of Data Analysis . Submitted by James Quintin to Dr. Ian Mcloughlin.

This project uses the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to present live code, visualizations and explanations investigating the boxplot funtion. The code is written in  [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution package that contains all necessary software to run this notebook.  

The notebook first explains what a boxplot is then explains the history and use of the boxplot. Examples of boxplots are then presented using python code. References then follows.
