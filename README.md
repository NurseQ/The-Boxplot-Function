# The Box plot Function
A project investigating the box plot function for the course Fundamentals of Data Analysis . Submitted by James Quintin to Dr. Ian Mcloughlin.

This project uses the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to present live code, visualizations and explanations investigating the box plot function. The code is written in  [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution package that contains all necessary software to run this notebook.  

The notebook first explains what a box plot is, then explains the history and use of the box plot. Examples of box plots are then presented using python code followed by the references.
